[Spacescan.io](https://www.spacescan.io/) is an initiative mainly developed for the chia community to explore the chia blockchain. Spacescan is an easy accessible blockchain explorer and analytics platform with indepth details about the chia blockchain.

## Min chia transactions fees

During dust storms, you can use the below min fees to get transactions in next block.
We calculate fees based on 5M cost estimate and this is more than enough to get your transaction into next block in chia block chain.

## Min fees trend chart

Spacescan added new chart exclusively for mempool Min Fees. Initially, this mempool min fees were combined with mempool fees chart. To bring clarity, now mempool Min fees are seprated into its own chart to bring the trend.

## Navigation

This new change can be viewed in the spacescan explorer, under the charts sections. Inside the chart dropdown section, there is a dedicated column for the mempool, where we can find the link for mempool min fees. This would give the min fees in mojos for 5M cost transactions.
 
The one month and one year mempool min fees details might take some time to load as the we have been storing the min fees data for few weeks.
