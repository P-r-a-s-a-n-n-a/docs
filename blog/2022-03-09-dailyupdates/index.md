[Spacescan.io](https://www.spacescan.io/) is an initiative mainly developed for the chia community to explore the chia blockchain. Spacescan is an easy accessible blockchain explorer and analytics platform with indepth details about the chia blockchain.

Spacescan added new chart exclusively for mempool Min Fees. Initially, this mempool min fees where combined with mempool fees. We removed and created a new chart for mempool Min fees for better visibility.

## Navigation

This new change can be viewed in the spacescan explorer, under the charts sections. Inside the chart dropdown section, there is a dedicated column for the mempool, where we can find the link for mempool min fees. This would give the user about the min fees in mojos based on different timeperiod
 
The one month and one year mempool min fees details might take some time to load as the we have been storing the min fees data for few weeks.
