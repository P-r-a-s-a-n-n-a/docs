### 2. Improved Stability of parser engine
- We have re-written our parser engine for the third time to bring more stability in our sync process and to support future wallets like NFT, DID and RL. There are multiple bug reports in our discord channel on the difference of wallet balance. We have fixed most of those changes and it would bring stable balances across our supported wallet types.
